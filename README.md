codeclub-online-editor
======================

A really simple HTML/CSS editor for use at codeclub if the machines don't have anything good installed...

* Inserts the HTML and CSS straight into a iframe without any server communication allows quick feedback 
* Automatically saves work every time it is previewed
* Easily view work in full screen mode
* Server side REST API can be implemented in any language (just requires CORS support)
